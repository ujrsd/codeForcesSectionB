## Programming Language

To solve the different kind of tasks, `C++` is used.

## Used template for every task

```C++
/*
    Problem Name:
    Difficulty  :
*/
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Inputs

    // Logic
    // Insert Code here - without return statement

    // Outputs
}
```

When writing a solution, using a return statment like it `return 1` or return `return 0` leads to a runtime error in the `main` function.

The site works like the following:

- **Inputs** are given with the `std::cin` function
- **Outputs** are recieved with the `std::cout` function

Therefore, the console cannot be used to get informations for the user on how to run the programm properly.
